Its Pretty Self explaitory what it does
I am not at fault if you get banned whilst using this 
Ive made a disconnect spam (which you can turn off) in the ui which allows you to use the mod offline and not in a room, this means you can use it if your not in a room
simple
modded only aswell, you cant use this in normal/public gamemodes (i think me not test cuz scared)

## Usage
Once the GUI is open, you’ll see three main sections plus a safety button at the top:
Safety Controls
- Safety Disconnect Spam
Spam-disconnects you from the session to help dodge potential bans before messing with gravity.

## Gravity Things
- Randomise Gravity
Applies a random gravitational force each time you press.
- No Gravity
Turns gravity off completely—float around like you’re in space.
- Reset / Normal Gravity
Restores the game’s default gravity settings.

## Axis Gravity Things
- Y axis Grav (Upwards Gravity)
Gravity pulls you upward instead of down.
- X axis Grav
Gravity pulls you sideways along the X axis.
- Z axis Grav
Gravity pulls you forward/back along the Z axis.
- Y axis Grav (Downwards Gravity)
Standard downward pull (included for easy resetting of custom Y-axis tweaks).
- -X axis Grav
Gravity pulls you in the negative X direction.
- -Z axis Grav
Gravity pulls you in the negative Z direction.

## Stupid Gravity Things
- Random Spam Gravity
Rapidly toggles gravity up and down left and right for comedic chaos.
- Low Gravity
Reduce gravity to a fraction of its normal strength—moonwalking encouraged.
- High Gravity
Crank gravity up to ludicrous levels—feel like you’re anchored to the floor.

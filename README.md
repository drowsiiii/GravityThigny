## Usage -
Once the GUI is open, you’ll see three main sections plus a safety button at the top:

## Safety Controls:
- Safety Disconnect Spam
Spam-disconnects you from the session (basically making you offline) to help dodge your account from being banned as your messing with gravity.

I mainly added this because of two things:
Im scared of the mod banning someone or myself for using it in a room
I dont want anyone complaining they got banned 
This is ment to be used OFFLINE.
## LOOK AT THE SAFETY DISCALMER

## Gravity Things:
- Randomise Gravity
Applies a random gravitational force each time you press.
- No Gravity
Turns gravity off completely—float around like you’re in space.
- Reset / Normal Gravity
Restores the game’s default gravity settings.

## Axis Gravity Things:
- Y axis Grav (Upwards Gravity)
Gravity pulls you upward instead of down.
- X axis Grav
Gravity pulls you sideways along the X axis.
- Z axis Grav
Gravity pulls you forward/back along the Z axis.
- Y axis Grav (Downwards Gravity)
Standard downward pull (included for easy resetting of custom Y-axis tweaks).
- -X axis Grav
Gravity pulls you in the negative X direction.
- -Z axis Grav
Gravity pulls you in the negative Z direction.

## Stupid Gravity Things:
- Random Spam Gravity
Rapidly toggles gravity up and down left and right for comedic chaos.
- Low Gravity
Reduce gravity to a fraction of its normal strength—moonwalking encouraged.
- High Gravity
Crank gravity up to ludicrous levels—feel like you’re anchored to the floor.
